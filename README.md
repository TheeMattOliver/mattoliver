<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

My hope is that a website provides a helpful example of some of the most recent product and web development work I've done, and that by putting it in one place, I can reason about where I'm going.

The site is live at [mattoliver.xyz](https://mattoliver.xyz).

I'm always interested in working with misfits, outcasts, and hell-raisers who want to create positive change and challenge the status quo. If you like what you see, please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:mattoliver.mattoliver@gmail.com).

## Overview

I built the project with Gatsby. I used Sanity as the CMS. I wrote the CSS from scratch, mainly using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

The responsive grid and table of contents component on the individual project pages took some doing! Please feel free to leave some feedback through the contact form.

#### Built With

- Front-end: [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
- Backend: [Sanity](https://sanity.io)
- Animations: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- Deployed with [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

<!-- DESIGN -->

## 📌 Design

I wanted to focus on the stories behind the projects, the technologies used, some of the challenges I faced while building them, and to keep things simple.

### Figma

The [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/U7LRjFK3yqItc2eJe7cPdM/Oliver-Portfolio-2021?node-id=0%3A1) project I worked from can be found here. It's a very simple and straightforward set of design tokens while I build a proper design system.

### Fonts:

Wherever possible I believe in supporting indie type foundries, but truth be told, I'm broke at the moment, and I needed to get this thing off the ground so I'm just using the [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/) for now.

- `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";`

## 📈 Performance

Lighthouse scores. Pure vanity.
